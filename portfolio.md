## Projects

### Natural Language Processing --
<!-- 1. [**Twitter Sentiment Analysis**](https://github.com/ebolotin6/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis/) -->
1. <a href="https://github.com/ebolotin6/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis/" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter Sentiment Analysis</strong></a>
	* **Project purpose**: To answer the question: are people that talk about fitness happier than people that talk about media (tv, movies, youtube, etc.)?
	* **Project scope**: data collection, cleaning, sentiment and statistical analysis, and presentation.
	* **Info**: Twitter data is collected using REST and Stream APIs, then cleaned, organized, and (sentiment) analyzed. Sentiment analysis is performed using Natural Language Toolkit VADER Sentiment Analysis. All of this is done in Python. Statistical analysis performed in R. 
	* **Other**: <a href="https://github.com/ebolotin6/Twitter_Sentiment_Analyzer/" target="_blank"><strong>Twitter Sentiment Analyzer</strong></a> is the standalone program created to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data.

### Imputation & Predictive Modeling --
<!-- 1. [**Fargo Health Group Case**](https://github.com/ebolotin6/Fargo_Health_Group_Case/) -->
1. <a href="https://github.com/ebolotin6/Fargo_Health_Group_Case/" target="_blank"><strong>Fargo Health Group Case</strong></a>
	* **Project purpose**: To demonstrate imputation and predictive modeling for a business case.
	* **Project scope**: data cleaning, imputation, model creation, statistical analysis, and presentation.
	* **Info**: The Fargo Health Group (FHG) Case is a Harvard Business Review case. The goal of the case is to create a predictive model to forecast medical examinations for a health organization (FHG). See the project readme for more details and viewing instructions.

### Machine & Deep Learning -- 

* *In development*

### Scripts and code --
<!-- * **Data cleaning and analysis (Amazon Reviews)**: [part 1: Python](https://github.com/ebolotin6/UW_Assignments/blob/master/assignment_11/assignment11_python.ipynb), [part 2: R](https://github.com/ebolotin6/UW_Assignments/blob/master/assignment_11/assignment11_R.pdf) -->

	* **Project purpose**: Analyze Amazon reviews to determine which characteristics make them most helpful.
	* **Project scope**: Data cleaning, manipulation, and statistical analysis.
	* **Info**:	This project cleans and prepares data for statistical analysis (part 1), and then determines the characteristics of "helpful" vs "unhelpful" Amazon.com reviews (part 2).
<br /><br />
<!-- * [**Working with classes (OOP)**](https://github.com/ebolotin6/UW_Assignments/blob/master/assignment_12/assignment12_python.ipynb) -->
* <a href="https://github.com/ebolotin6/UW_Assignments/blob/master/assignment_12/assignment12_python.ipynb" target="_blank"><strong>Working with classes (OOP)</strong></a>
	* **Project purpose**: Demonstrate expertise of classes and OOP in Python.
	* **Project scope**: Coding.
	* **Info**:	This project is an exercise in Python classes.
<br /><br />
<!-- * [**Hypothesis Testing**](https://github.com/ebolotin6/UW_Assignments/blob/master/assignment_8/Assignment_8_R.pdf) -->
* <a href="https://github.com/ebolotin6/UW_Assignments/blob/master/assignment_8/Assignment_8_R.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Hypothesis Testing</strong></a>
	* **Project purpose**: (a) To use statistical testing to determine the author of an anonymous essay - and - (b) to identify the language of encrypted text.
	* **Project scope**: Statistical analysis (R)
	* **Info**: The goal of this project is to use hypothesis testing (T-Test and Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit in this case) to evaluate the truth of some claim (comparing sample vs population).
<br /><br />
<!-- * [**Text parsing & word counting**](https://github.com/ebolotin6/UW_Assignments/blob/master/assignment_7/assignment7_python.ipynb) -->
* <a href="https://github.com/ebolotin6/UW_Assignments/blob/master/assignment_7/assignment7_python.ipynb" target="_blank"><strong>Text parsing & word counting</strong></a>
	* **Project purpose**: To perform statistics on arbitrary text using Python.
	* **Project scope**: Data manipulation, analysis.
	* **Info**: The <a href="https://github.com/ebolotin6/UW_Assignments/blob/master/assignment_7/WordLength_Calc_v2.py" target="_blank">primary code</a> from this assignment was developed to analyze sentences from arbitrary text. It is an example of parsing and data analysis using Python.
